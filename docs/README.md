## Price predictions of laptops available on marketplace

The aim of this model is to predict prices of laptops based on a set of features, e.g. processor, CPU, operational system, etc.I have tested a few models (including linear regression and random forest) to minimize an error (RSME) between my predictions and real values.

## NLP: Sentiment analysis with DistilBERT on books' reviews

In this model I was trying to predict rating of a book (0-5 star) based on a text review. For this task I decided to use a light, distilled version of BERT model, DistilBERT. It's a powerful model, bidirectional and requiring relatively low training data and computational resources, which makes it a good choice for the purpose of this project. I have fine-tuned a DistilBERT model with 90k training dataset.
