## NLP: Sentiment analysis with DistilBERT on books' reviews

In this model I was trying to predict rating of a book (0-5 star) based on a text review. For this task I decided to use a light, distilled version of BERT model, DistilBERT. It's a powerful model, bidirectional and requiring relatively low training data and computational resources, which makes it a good choice for the purpose of this project. I have fine-tuned a DistilBERT model with 90k training dataset.

### Third-level header

Most search engines index only up to H3 for searches

#### Level 4 header, aka H4

People remember only about 3 levels of a hierarchy

##### H5

Who goes this low? and why?
